# Birthdays

## Overview
The **Birthdays** problem is part of CS50â€™s Problem Set 9. In this exercise, you will create a web application that allows users to record and display birthdays. You will use a database to store information, interact with the user through forms, and dynamically display the birthdays on the website.

The goal of this exercise is to practice working with databases, SQL, and web development frameworks like Flask (Python).
