# Filter (Less)

## Overview
This program applies a variety of image filters (grayscale, sepia, reflect, and blur) to bitmap images in the `.bmp` format. It is designed as part of Harvard's CS50 course and demonstrates basic image processing techniques using C.

## Features
- **Grayscale**: Converts an image to shades of gray by averaging the RGB values of each pixel.
- **Sepia**: Applies a sepia tone effect by calculating new RGB values based on a specific formula.
- **Reflect**: Mirrors an image horizontally.
- **Blur**: Applies a simple box blur by averaging the RGB values of neighboring pixels.

## How to Use
1. **Compile the Program**  
   Use the following command to compile the program:
   ```bash
   make filter
