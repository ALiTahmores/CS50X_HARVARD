# Mario (More Comfortable)

This program generates a two-sided pyramid similar to those in the Mario video game series. The pyramid's height is determined by the user and must be an integer between 1 and 8. The program ensures valid input and then prints the pyramid to the console.

## How It Works

1. **User Input:**
   - The program prompts the user to enter the height of the pyramid.
   - Input must be an integer between **1** and **8**.
   - If the input is invalid, the user will be prompted again until a valid height is provided.

2. **Pyramid Construction:**
   - The pyramid consists of two halves separated by two spaces.
   - Each row contains:
     - Leading spaces to align the pyramid.
     - Hashes (`#`) to form the left side.
     - Two spaces for separation.
     - Hashes (`#`) to form the right side.

3. **Output:**
   - The pyramid is printed row by row to the console.
